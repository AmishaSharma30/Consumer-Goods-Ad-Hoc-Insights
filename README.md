# Consumer Goods Ad-Hoc Insights

## Project Overview :-
Atliq Hardwares, a leading computer hardware producer, faced challenges in generating actionable insights for data-informed decision-making. This project showcases SQL and Power BI skills to address 10 business-critical ad-hoc requests, analyze sales trends, and create dynamic visualizations to support strategic planning.

## Project Goals:-
- Solve 10 ad-hoc SQL queries to extract insights on customers, products, and sales data.
